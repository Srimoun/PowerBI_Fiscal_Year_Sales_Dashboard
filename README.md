# My First Power BI Dashboard – Fiscal Year Sales Analysis

## Overview
This is my first Power BI dashboard created to understand sales trends
using a fiscal year approach. The fiscal year is considered from
April to March, which is commonly used in many companies.

## What I Did
- Created a fiscal year starting from April and ending in March
- Analyzed sales month-wise using fiscal months
- Built cumulative (running total) sales to understand growth over time
- Compared sales across different regions (Central, East, West, South)
- Created monthly sales charts to view month-wise performance

## Dashboard Features
- Cumulative sales by region and fiscal year
- Monthly sales by region and fiscal year
- Simple and clean visuals without over-complication
- One-page dashboard layout

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX
- Power Query

## Notes
This dashboard was built in a simple and beginner-friendly way to focus
on understanding fiscal year logic and cumulative calculations.
More enhancements can be added in future versions.
